cuda-tests-on-matrices
======================

This repository has been created in an attempt to carry out some tests on matrices operations using CUDA. It contains my very first CUDA-codes.

Have a look to [CUDA MathModule for Python](https://github.com/dubzzz/cuda-mathmodule-for-python).
It gives you ways to define Python data-structures in C/C++ code.
